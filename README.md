# Rae Crochets

This is a blog used to document my crochet projects. It displays a project showcase, personal profile, and complete project descriptions. It was made using Javascript. More specifically, with React, styled-components, and recharts.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
